# Data Analysis Project with Power BI and Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Analysis Project with Power BI. This repository contains an in-depth analysis of data sourced from a hardware company. The main objectives of this analysis include:

- Calculating key metrics such as total revenue and total sales quantity.
- Segmenting data by markets and analyzing revenue and sales quantity by market.
- Visualizing the revenue trend over time using a line chart.
- Identifying the top 5 customers and top 5 products based on sales.
- Calculating profit margins, contribution percentages, and other relevant insights.

## Project Structure

- `data.sql`: This SQL file contains the raw data used in the analysis.
- `PowerBI_Report.pbix`: This Power BI report file contains the visualizations and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - The data was sourced from a hardware company, superstores, finance and many other sources and is stored in an SQL file.
   - The data includes information such as sales, purchases, and market data.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Filtered out records with zero and negative sales amounts.
   - Converted all USD amounts to INR currency.
   - Removed blank purchases if the market did not purchase them.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculated key metrics including total revenue, total sales quantity, and profit margins.
   - Segmented data by markets and analyzed revenue and sales quantity by market.
   - Created a line chart to visualize the revenue trend over time.
   - Identified the top 5 customers and top 5 products based on sales.

4. **Power BI Visualizations**:
   - Power BI reports and dashboards have been created to visualize the analysis results.
   - The reports include various charts, tables, and visualizations to present insights effectively.

5. **Results and Recommendations**:
   - Key results include total revenue, total sales quantity, profit margins, top customers, top products, and market-wise revenue analysis.
   - Recommendations and insights based on the analysis are provided.
